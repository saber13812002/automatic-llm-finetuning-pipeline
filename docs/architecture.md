# Architecture

The repository wraps LLaMA-Factory SFT; it prepares artifacts and manages runs
without changing the upstream trainer or its dataset registry.

## Inputs and outputs

Inputs are YAML sections for a HuggingFace model name, dataset source and alias,
and supported training parameters. The normal LoRA result is an adapter plus
saved tokenizer files, not a complete standalone copy of the base model.

```text
Model name -> Model Compatibility Layer -> family/template ----+
Training parameters -> Training Configuration -> validated args+-> training.yaml
Dataset -> source adapter -> schema adapter -> normalization --+-> dataset_info.json
                                                                     |
                                                               LLaMA-Factory
                                                                     |
                                                               LoRA adapter
                                                                     |
                                                             Artifact validation
                                                                     |
                                                           success / failed metadata
```

Run management, metadata, and logging apply throughout. Full-method output is
supported by configuration/artifact checks but was not actually trained in acceptance.

## Actual execution order

1. Load and check the default or explicitly supplied input YAML.
2. Allocate a unique run directory and snapshot the input config.
3. Capture best-effort environment/container context and resolve model
   family/template plus requested/resolved HuggingFace revision.
4. Validate supported training fields and method-specific settings.
5. Snapshot the dataset source and load it through the source adapter registry.
6. Detect/validate its schema, normalize it, and validate SFT-compatible rows.
7. Write normalized JSON, hash its exact bytes with SHA-256, then write run-local
   `dataset_info.json`, resolved input config, and LLaMA-Factory training YAML.
8. Launch the upstream CLI with this interpreter and absolute YAML path. Write
   every raw stdout/stderr chunk to the persistent run log, then independently
   filter/format the same live stream for quiet, concise, or full console output.
9. On exit zero, verify expected nonempty model artifacts, normalize final metrics
   from Trainer JSON artifacts, and only then mark success.
10. On handled errors, mark failure, preserve the error log, and raise the error.
    Print a final run summary for training completion/failure.

Model/config validation failures happen before dataset preparation/training but
can still leave a run directory, input snapshot, metadata, and error log.
Malformed input rejected before run allocation does not have run-scoped metadata.
The same `logs/train.log` also receives pipeline lifecycle logger records, so it
is a combined lifecycle log containing the complete unfiltered backend stream,
not a backend-only file.

## Module responsibilities

All modules below live under `src/fine_tuning_pipeline/` and are imported as
`fine_tuning_pipeline.<module>`. The default config is `configs/config.yaml`;
package installation is editable from this checkout. Relocation does not change
the runtime flow or the LLaMA-Factory artifact contract.

| Current module | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `train_pipeline.py` | Config loading, preparation, execution, lifecycle orchestration |
| `dataset_adapter.py` | Stable facade over the modular dataset framework |
| `dataset_adapters/base.py`, `registry.py` | Adapter contracts, scoring, registry selection, conversion |
| Dataset source/schema modules | Format-specific loading, validation, normalization |
| `dataset_loader.py` | Unified SFT row validation |
| `dataset_config_generator.py` | Run-local LLaMA-Factory dataset registration |
| `model_manager.py` | Model-family detection, generation/template mapping, compatibility warnings/errors |
| `training_config.py` | Supported parameter validation and typed argument mapping |
| `yaml_generator.py` | Complete run-specific YAML generation and backend-specific checkpointing translation |
| `trainer.py` | Upstream subprocess launch and combined training log capture |
| `run_manager.py` | Unique paths, snapshots, metadata persistence, logging |
| `artifact_validator.py` | Expected nonempty artifact checks for LoRA/full |
| `observability.py` | Dataset digest, environment/container/resource capture, final metric extraction |
| `console_output.py` | Streaming quiet/concise/full backend-console presentation |

## Adapter stages

The source registry handles file/container loading; the schema registry handles
record meaning. CSV and JSONL are therefore not separate copies of every schema
adapter. Named-field adapters share `FieldMappingAdapter`; conversation adapters
share validation and per-assistant-turn SFT expansion.

Automatic detection reports heuristic confidence, not a statistical guarantee.
The registry rejects similarly scored matches. Manual overrides force an adapter
but still validate the input; preference records are explicitly rejected for SFT.

## Run contract

```text
runs/<UTC timestamp>_<model>_<dataset>[_collision suffix]/
  config/input_config.yaml
  config/resolved_config.yaml
  config/training.yaml
  dataset/original_dataset.<extension>
  dataset/normalized_dataset.json
  dataset/dataset_info.json
  logs/train.log
  model/
  environment.json
  metadata.json
```

Local datasets are copied with their source extension. Hub input gets an
`original_dataset.json` source/options descriptor, not a full raw dataset export.
LLaMA-Factory receives the run's dataset and model directories as absolute paths.
Collision-safe allocation never overwrites a previous run.

`metadata.json` uses additive schema version 2. Existing lifecycle, model,
dataset, training, and output fields remain. New blocks record reproducible
inputs, environment/container context, conservative resource measurements,
normalized final metrics, and the base-model/adapter relationship.
`trainer_state.json` stays authoritative for per-step `log_history`; metadata
links to it instead of duplicating a potentially large history.

The provider-neutral serving handoff is planning data only. Endpoint serving,
vLLM launch, LiteLLM registration, model merging, and Project #2 integration are
outside this phase.

LoRA validation requires nonempty `adapter_config.json` and
`adapter_model.safetensors`. Full-method checks require nonempty `config.json`
and matching safetensors/bin weight files. These are existence/size checks, not
complete shard/integrity certification. Real LoRA deserialization was separately
proved during acceptance; inference is not invoked automatically by this flow.

Handled preparation/training errors are recorded. Power loss can leave stale
status because no process survives to finalize it; automatic restart/reconciliation
is not implemented. See [acceptance limitations](acceptance_report.md).
